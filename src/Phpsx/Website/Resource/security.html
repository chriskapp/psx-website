				<li>If the report is rejected send an explanation to the reporter why.</li>
				<li>If the report is accepted inform the reporter about the acceptance and that we are working on a fix.</li>
				<li>Develop a fix in private.</li>
				<li>Provide the reporter with a copy of the fix and a draft vulnerability announcement for comment.</li>
				<li>Agree on the fix, the announcement and the release schedule with the reporter.</li>
				<li>Commit the fix.</li>
				<li>Create a new release that includes the fix.</li>
